I'm a software engineer at [Identified](http://www.identified.com) with the super technical title of **Stuff**. The **Stuff** that I do is write code, fire up servers, hate Chef, manage VMs and pretty much whatever else I feel like doing. 


[RBSavvy](http://rbsavvy.com) is my startup with [Ricky](http://rickychilcott.com) and [Zach](http://zachkuzmic.com), where I do pretty much the same **stuff**, just in my free time.
